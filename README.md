## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox; for the card content
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for card events

### What I learned

I practiced the _eventListener_ functions to manage the events in the rating options and submit button.

### Continued development

I want to continue practice in more general events with Js.

### Useful resources

- [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - This help me to add the listener for the event click for the options in rating. Also, for the click in the _submit_ button.
- [ClassList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) - This help me to add or remove the _active_ class for the elements in the card.
- [HTML value attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDataElement/value) - This help me to handled the rating selected to submit.
